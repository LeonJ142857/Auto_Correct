# Auto_Correct
Auto correct is a really useful feature in our daily life because it allows for people to communicate better through texting and misunderstand each other less.
This auto correct project is simply a simple demonstration of how algorithms can be applied in our daily life. In this case, we try to apply the Trie data structure and the algorithms corresponding to it in order to make our auto correct feature work correctly and efficiently. For the time being, we haven't measured the performance yet and if time allows, we will try to make it happen. And also, we will also try to make the underlying Trie data structure persistent in the sense that we are able to load from previous state of our program after closing and re-running it.
